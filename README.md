# sensorz

A Simple Flutter Android App, which displays Android Sensor Data.



## Introduction ::

  - For implementation of UI, this app uses Flutter Framework.
  - Code base is written mainly using Dart and Kotlin, these two languages.
  - For accessing platform features, such as **Sensors**, Kotlin Language is used.
  - UI level coding is done using Dart Language.
  - For receiving continuous sensor data feed from platform, EventChannel is used.
  - This Android App is tested to be properly working on Android Oreo (8.1.0).
  - This app uses Android Sensors Feature ( **android.hardware.sensor** ).
  - To install apk using **adb**, try running following command in your computer's console,
   after downloading apk. Make sure you have adb installed and PATH variable is properly set.
